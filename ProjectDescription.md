As the name suggests, this is a tinder clone built using ReactJS, ReactRouter, Material UI and Firebase.
It's a fun project to learn:
  1. How to integrate React with firebase to fetch realtime date?
  2. How to use Material UI?
  4. How to break down UI into components and write modular code (well, that's what react is all about)?
  5. How to use React router to navigate to pages?
  6. How to deploy react project using firebase hosting?
